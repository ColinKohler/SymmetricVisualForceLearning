title: Symmetric Models for Visual-Force Learning 
---

**Abstract:** While it is generally acknowledged that force feedback is beneficial to robotic control, applications of policy learning to robotic manipulationtypically only 
leverage visual feedback. Recently, symmetric neural models have been used to significantly improve the sample efficiency and performance of policy learning across a variety
of robotic manipulation domains. This paper explores an application of symmetric policy learning to visual-force problems. We present Symmetric Visual Force Learning (SVFL), 
a novel method for robotic control which leverages visual and force feedback. We demonstrate that SVFL can significantly outperform state of the art baselines for visual 
force learning and report several interesting empiricalfindings related to the utility of learning force feedback control policies in both general manipulation tasks and
scenarios with low visual acuity.
